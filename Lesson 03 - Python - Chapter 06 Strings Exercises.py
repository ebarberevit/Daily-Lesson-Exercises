# Exercise 1: Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and works its way backwards to the first character in the string, printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.

# Exercise 2: Given that fruit is a string, what does fruit[:] mean?

# Exercise 3: Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments

# Exercise 4: There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise. Read the documentation of this method at https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods and write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in "banana"

# Exercise 5: Take the following Python code that stores a string:`
# str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
# Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.

# Exercise 6:
# Read the documentation of the string methods at
# https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
# You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.
# The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is optional.
