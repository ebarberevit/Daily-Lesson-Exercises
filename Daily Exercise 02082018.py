# Your Name - Python Daily Exercise number (seperate out this activity into three seperate .py files for each exercise) - date of learning
# For example on line 1 (files should be named like shown on lines 3, 5, 7 for your .py files without the hashtag#):
# John Smith - Python Daily Exercise 1 - Date you created the file for example month, date, and year like this: 02082018
#   Remove exercises 2 and 3 for exercise 1
# John Smith - Python Daily Exercise 2 - Date you created the file 
#   Remove exercises 1 and 3 for exercise 2
# John Smith - Python Daily Exercise 3 - Date you created the file
#   Remove exercises 1 and 2 for exercise 3

# Instructions - create a file for each of the daily exercises, answer each question seperately

# 1. Write a statement that concatenates at least two variables (you can have more than 2 for this practice).
# use the string and integer functions, no arithmetic will be allowed for this exercise (i.e. - x*y), 
# combine two variables for a string a variable. The key word here is CONCATENATE.

# 2. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. Clue input()

#3 Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 20. 
# For multiples of three, print "usb" instead of the number and for the mulitiples of five, print "device". 
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "usb device".
# Print a new line after each string or number.
